It's not a sercret that I generally hold disdain for the current copyright
system in place in most of the world. I think copyright as it exists in
our current worldwide legal system stifles creativity, innovation, and
free expression.

These writings below have informed my view on the copyright system
as it exists right now. I think they're good reads!

This does not mean I break copyright law left and right as a hobby - 
I am a willing participant in society after all. These documents infer
my _opinions and beliefs_ about the _current copyright system in place_
but not my _practices_.
