for the longest time i tried my hardest to be nonchalant and a little
dismissive about the things i do. 

why? 

because it's somewhat trendy to just
care less about the things you do and seem "cool and distant."

i think i'm getting over that.

i want to share the things i like with the world even if only a few people
are willing to sit down and listen.

i want to talk to people about the things i like and i wanna hear people talk
about the things they like, without it being somehow "embarassing" because
"oh thats not real emo" or "boo this artist sucks /love"

i want to talk about the thing that happened in 2023 that i just found out about
without being judged as "behind the times." i don't care that they're not "real
blablabla"

my girlfriend told me i was failing at being nonchalant. yeah. because deep down
i do care. i care a lot. i care a lot about the things and the people around it.

and you know what?

i like it!

when i was on the L train first thinking about this it went something like this:

"you know what fuck it i can't be nonchalant thats not who i am"

"as a kid i wanted to share what i know with the world and thats what i want to do going forward"

"i thought society placed an affect on me but it was really just me limiting myself"
