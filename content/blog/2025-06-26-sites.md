There's a new theme on this site. Believe it or not, it's almost
_less readable_ than the previous one! The sidebars are kludgy
and work weirdly on mobile. _This is intentional_

I've been browsing lots of blogs and personal sites lately 
(mostly thanks to a certain orange website), and I've noticed a
trend that messier blogs sites end up catching my attention
more. [Terence Eden](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/)'s and 
[Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/)'s sites come to mind, and not
to mention [Izzy](https://izzys.casa/2024/11/on-safe-cxx/)'s
GOAT-tier C++ post. These are sites that are generally
thought of to be less "sleek" and "clean," but exude a personality
that reflect their author.

## Creativity and identity

Hanging out with punks in the Minneapolis scene has given me
a bit of a unique perspective on how creativity and identity
work hand-in-hand. The mere _act_ of creation and iteration
of works of any kind, from visual novels to music, impresses
upon others that your creations are _part_, or rather _a result_
of your experiences and concioussness - sort of an antithesis
to a reverse "death of the author." (I don't intend on litigating
the death of the author, but I think most artists agree that 
putting out a piece of work means it is seen in the wider
context of the artist who created the work at hand)

Thus, the _identity_ of a website should also impress
upon the reader the _identity_ of the entity which created
the site. The entities, whether corporate or personal,
already get this - most governments have a design language
that their department websites generally keep to.

## The medium is the message

A groupchat I'm in recently got into an argument about how
movie adaptations of video game franchises generally don't
work out - most of them turn out to be terrible, and this
exposes what I think about art and presentation -
"the medium is the message."

There's a reason beyond the technical that me and other
people in the photography space shoot film - it isn't
just about "the grain" or "the vibe" (although a good
amount of it _is_ that), but that the artist has chosen
a technically inferior format to convey the message
_because_ it is the best format to convey the message.

I'm not going to pretend I've read McLuhan's book 
of the same title, but _generally speaking_ the
sentiment posited by the slogan is one that I think holds
true more often than not.

## So why do so many tech-y blog sites look so... _bland_?

It's generally agreed upon that despite all the rhetoric
about tech "upsetting industries" that our sector
in general is a conformist one. We generally rush to the trendiest
web frameworks, the forming bubbles, the shiny new thing. 
I'm not innocent of being in that crowd too, but in this pursuit
of the latest and greatest I think we lose sight that our
message changes the medium - the _context_ includes things
we often see as otherwise disposable. 

It's also about effort - getting something like this running
is a lot more challenging than the Terminimal theme that I used
before this (it's still not a bad theme). Plonking a theme
that's premade is much simpler than spending the good part of
a day writing CSS. 

### An aside: virtiol about the Anubis anime girl

So another thing about this is that we as a community might be
forcing boring blandness _by force._ When the Anubis proxy first became popular
I saw quite a bit of vitriol about it online.

For reference - this is what gets shown:

![Picture of the Anubis anime girl that is typically shown when your soul is getting weighed](/img/pensive.webp)

Like c'mon. It's shown for like five seconds. If you're the kind of person
that gets angry about this - I don't know what to say other than that your
opinion should not hold any weight in our community.

This comment summarizes everything that needs to be said about the vitriol
to the girl above:

> Also: if youâ€™re intimidated or put off by a drawing that appears, on
> average, for less than 5 seconds, I strongly recommend you turn off your 
> computer and go outside for a while.

One has to wonder whether we enforce our frankly absurd dichotomies of 
"professional-looking" vs "silly, childish toys" with threats (and sometimes
enacted-upon) of violence (or notions of violence.)

## Makes websites that make you smile!

That's the whole point of making a website, no? To share the thoughts,
writings, and outputs of your work with pride. So why not have a personal
site that _feels_ like you? 

We need to push back against 
[far more consequential things](/copyright-abolition), but this is one
easy-to-make step in that pushback against all that's going on in
this frankly absurd world we live in and share.
