# Growing Old

Just last week I turned 24. Truthfully it hasn't even settled that my early 
twenties is now over. I _feel_ the same, and that's the part that scares me 
the most. I'll aim to jot down my thoughts on why, but this one's gonna be
awfully rambly, even compareed to my other thoughts in the blog.

# The year as a marker of age does not make sense.

Society puts a great big value on age as counted by year. I will concede that
having a consistent counter for how long a person has existed is a useful
conecpt, but I don't think the year is necessarily the best way to do it,
at least not for me. I am not substantially different from the person who
crossed July 18 2024, and I will not be substantially different from the
person who crosses July 18 2026, but I will be substantially different
from the person who crossed July 18 2023, and I will (most likely) be 
substantially different from the person who crosses July 18 2027. This tells me
that a lot can change within two years that one really doesn't. 

Of course, we reach for the year as a marker because it's a good marker for the
seasons - my age increments as we enter the warmest parts of the summer. Lots of
processes (particularly agriculture, _general_ culture, and most businesses)
run on that cycle. I don't think the progression of age necessarily reflect a
full seasonal cycle. Much like how a year is 365.2425 days (I don't think a 
measure of days is necesarily a better incrementer for age either, but I
digress), I think the best incrementer of age is somewhere in the middle of two
years. At least, that's how I think I change.

# My "early twenties" are over.

I'm 24. That's firmly in the "mid-twenties." My risk taking calculus has
changed, and the people I interact with have changed (I haven't really cycled
through the people I interact with, moreso that the people I interact with have
changed as people). 

It's honestly kind of a bummer, but also a bit of relief. Modern society makes
it seem like your early twenties are a "magical period". The bummer comes from
the understanding that this "magical period" is over. The relief is that I don't
feel any different from the person who *was* me in my early twenties. I'm still
endlessly curious, I'm still finding people who are currently (or will be)
lifelong contacts. ~~I'm still drinking a lot with my friends.~~ Going into my
"mid-twenties," if things stay the same, I'm tempted to say that this period
isn't really all that different from the "early-twenties."

# Advice for both people who are younger than older

Here's my one bit of advice that comes out of this rant - age really is kind of
a nothingburger unless you make it out to be. Sure, time will change you, but
you can still inject that spark back in you. Don't stress out about having a
perfect "early twenties" like I did. Don't stess out that you've lost the charm
of a specific age you were in - because the spark was in you all along.

Till next time,
