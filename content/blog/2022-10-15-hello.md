Welcome to the first post on my blog!

This first post attempts to test the features of Zola as well as [this template](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/) created by pawroman.

Below is some math: Apparently Zola allows _some_ external JS after all?

$$e^{\pi i} = - 1$$

Trying out code blocks here: I love C but it might be time to learn Rust?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Welcome to my blog!\n");
    return 0;
} 
```

Seems like everything I really need sort-of works! Can't wait to start actually working on blogposts!

Till next time,
