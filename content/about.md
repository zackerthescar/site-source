I'm r/c/s. You may see my first name as any name that starts with one
of those three letters. It doesn't matter which one you refer me to.

I'm a programmer, and I'm particularly fond of C even as I loathe and
hate _many_ aspects of that language. I'm also good at Python, Rust,
OCaml, TypeScript, and okay at C++, Java, and Haskell. I'm also writing
Go now apparently. I'm not good at Go.

I earned my BS and MS in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota
in May 2024 and May 2025 respectively.  

~~If you're a prospective employer, check out [my resume](/docs/resume_shaunloo.pdf)!~~
I am not actively looking for work at this time. My resume link remains working for
my most updated resume, but unless you're working on something I think is _very cool_,
I'm not likely to entertain an interview at this time. (I think my work is very cool,
at least right now).


I'm currently working on virtual machines and am loving it!
I love the craft of low-level programming and the art of understanding
a machine's aspects to extract the most performance. I was a teaching
assistant for UMN's Machine Architecture course for three semesters,
once overseeing all three available course sections. Some of my bigger 
projects, such as the FFmpeg VVC AVX-2 in-loop filters and PICO-386 
involve this sort of low-level programming. Check out my GitHub
linked above if you want to see what I've been up to!

I'm also interested in cryptography - I wrote multiple cryptography-based
challenges for ACM UMN's CTF events, writeups of which I might post
sometimes. I am not, however, interested in cryptocurrency. If you
contact me with any crypto-related stuff I will plonk you and move on.

I was once a regular volunteer at 
[Free Geek Twin Cities](https://www.freegeektwincities.org).
I truly believe in the cause that Free Geek Twin Cities champions, and the 
personnel there are extremely friendly and approchable. 

Outside of CS, I'm a huge audio nerd! I was the Studio Engineer at 
[Radio K](https://radiok.org), and hosted Circuit Board, the VGM show.

I am a [copyright abolitionist](/copyright-abolition). It's not a widely
known belief. It's probably my strongest opinion about how the world is run.

Thanks for checking this part of my site out
