I'm Shaun, a 21 year old junior Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota. I'm particularly fond of C as that's where I cut my teeth in programming, but I've found lots of fun in writing OCaml too. (Perhaps this is my calling to learn Rust?)

If you're a prospective employer, check out [my resume](/docs/resume_shaunloo_generic.pdf)!

Of all the subfields in CS, I love the more low-level stuff like memory access optimization, and reverse engineering. It's no wonder that I loved [CSCI 2021 Machine Architecture](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kauffman/2021/) so much! I might end up writing a blog post or two walking thru either the [infamous Bomb Lab](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~liqun/teaching/cs304/cs304_15f/labs/bomblab.html) or [efficient memory access methods for matrices](https://coffeebeforearch.github.io/2020/06/23/mmul.html) sometime, so stay tuned!

Another subfield of CS that I'm particularly passionate about is cryptography, although I have to admit that I haven't been keeping up with what's going on in cryptography lately. (Thanks, you insufferable oafs!) 

Outside of purely academic stuff, I'm the Systems Administrator for [UMN's ACM Student Chapter](https://acm.umn.edu). Sysadmin'ing for a rag-tag CS club is really fun, as everything is a bit of a dumpster fire! (There's IPs owned by the club that respond to pings that aren't accounted for - yet.)

Outside of CS, I'm a scheduled DJ on [Radio K](https://radiok.org)! An awkward CS student in the booth cracking terrible jokes and playing everything from hot garbage to GOAT tracks seems odd, but it's more common than you think- the Program Director and Traffic Director are CS students too. You can catch me live on [Radio K](https://radiok.org) on Thursdays from 9:00am to 11:00am!

I'm also a regular volunteer at [Free Geek Twin Cities](https://www.freegeektwincities.org). I truly believe in the cause that Free Geek Twin Cities champions, and the personnel there are extremely friendly and approchable. 

Outside of all that stuff, I'm just a guy who likes:
- Retro computers
- Anything and everything about space
- Music (Particularly metal, punk, and rock in general)
- I play guitar too!

I think that's all about what I have to say about myself, really. It's really, _really_ difficult to write about, well, yourself, since there's only your perspective talking. If you think any of this is exciting, do check back for new posts!

Till next time, 

Shaun.
