# The Quiet Kid

I'm not sure if it come across, but I've never exactly been the loud kid. If
you've met me IRL, you know I tend to not have much to say, even if I'm pretty
comfortable with you. The same goes for this blog!

The time in between the last post and this has been a whirlwind, though. I
suppose an update is in order.

# Another year in the bag

I took an entire year of purely compsci classes, and I seem to have done
pretty well by all metrics! These classes were all of great interest to me,
but even then I had to sell my soul to the devil for the grades I earned.

The classes that were particularly memorable were Operating Systems, Formal
Languages and Automata Theory, and Introduction to Parallel Programming. The
professors for these classes truly are GOATs, and the content were really
engaging.

This was the first year that I TA'ed for, too. I would like to think I was
a competent TA, if not a little too un-serious at times. 

# Summer of Everything

This summer is certainly a hectic one for me. Let's start from the top - 
I'm currently in the Google Summer of Code program, writing accelerated
decoding filters for FFmpeg! You can read about exactly what I'm doing
[here](/docs/ffmpeg_gsoc.pdf)! It's really exciting stuff, at the intersection
of multimedia and low-level computing. `x86_64` Assembly may be a daunting
task, and throwing SIMD on top of that makes it super inaccessible,
but it's really not that bad once you have a good infrastructure for
macros, and FFmpeg certainly has that in spades!

The other main shenangian I've been up to is that I'm now Studio Engineer
at Radio K! I'm in charge of the audio side of 
[Off the Record](https://radiok.org/record)! It's really an honor that I
get to record the amazing musicians in this part of the world and witness
it first-hand! You can hear my mixes as well as the amazing performances
[here](https://www.youtube.com/@RadioK770)!

One last thing is that [ACM UMN](https://acm.umn.edu/) is, after many long
years, _finally_ getting the upgraded 10-gigabit network! My tenure as
systems administrator may be over, but it's all-hands-on-deck for this
network upgrade, and I'm giving all the guidance I can to our new sysadmin
in this transition!

# Future of the Blog

My best friend recently talked to me about the lack of simple explainations
for digital multimedia - she's had to rely on me to explain lots of stuff
in digital audio and video. Essentially, there really isn't an accessible
resource for this stuff.

I'm planning to write a short series of blogposts on this site explaining
the stuff that goes into your codecs, from audio to video, and generally
just nerd out about digital audio and video in an accessible manner! Sort
of a more approachable version of 
[xiphmont's amazing "Digital Media Primer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG9jemV1T7I).
Stay tuned for those!

I'm also planning to write an article or two about `x86_64` assembly, SIMD,
and efficient memory access. I'm going to be a TA for Machine Architecture
and Organization next semester, so not only will this be a resource for future
students, but also gives me a chance to practice elegantly explaining this stuff!

Till next time,
