# Info

For Spring 2025, I will be a graduate TA for all three CSCI 2021 
Machine Architecture courses. This subsection of my website will 
be dedicated to info for students in any of the CSCI 2021 
sections in Spring 2025.

# Office Hours

My office hours will be `10:00am - 12:00pm` at `Keller Hall 2-209`.
Officially, the `10:00am - 11:00am` slot is dedicated to Professor
Exley's `001` section, and the `11:00am - 12:00pm` slot is dedicated
to Professor Kolb's `010` and `020` sections. I do not intend to keep
this as a "hard wall," so feel free to drop by and treat my OH as
a full 2-hour OH session.

> Note: while I don't intend to keep the "hard wall," I reserve the
> right to do so when I judge that the "hard wall" is needed to
> preserve fairness in   office hours access.

I am also available by appointment. Email me at `loo00013 at umn dot edu`
if you want to schedule an appointment.

# Resources to succeed

Machine Architecture is **one long infodump** about how a computer actually
works when you strip it down to bare essentials. You **need** to be
comfortable with **your** computermachine. Fortunately these are skills
that you can pick up rather easily.

- [ACM UMN](https://acm.umn.edu/) hosts Unix classes on the days
of 02/06, 02/20, and 02/27. IME people who arrive at Unix classes and
are interested in how their computers work tend to excel in the course.
Also this acts as a shameless plug to ACM UMN, of which I am a part of.

- [Beej's Quick Guide to GDB](https://beej.us/guide/bggdb/) is an amazing
tour of GDB. Scroll down to the bottom to get a very useful cheat sheet!

- For people in Professor Kolb's sections specifically,
[Docker Curriculum](https://docker-curriculum.com/) is a great way to
get started with Docker. Just ignore the AWS-y bits, that's more
`CSCI 3081W` territory that we shouldn't open.
    - If I take control of your computer and do crazy `docker`
    stuff, feel free to interrupt and ask me, I love explaining
    Docker commands!

- [The OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org) has some amazing
pages explaining the `x86-64` architecture that we study. I recommend
the pages on [SysV ABI](https://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI) and
[quirks about `x86-64`](https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64).

- [What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)
is something that I wish we can cover in classes completely, but 
attention spans are finite. We might be doing optimization
stuff later in the course though, so wink wink.

# Further reading

For the performance freaks who want to dabble in the dark arts of
optimizations:

- Agner Fog's amazing [optimization guides](https://www.agner.org/optimize/)
is a must-read for any performance freak, but I don't particularly recommend
reading it until the 2nd half of the course

- For further reading, 
[Ronald's `x86inc.asm` guide](https://blogs.gnome.org/rbultje/2017/07/14/writing-x86-simd-using-x86inc-asm/)
provides you with the tools necessary to produce what I consider to be
"production-grade" assembly.

# Expectations

While I don't expect you to refer to me formally (just call me by my 
first name), I expect you to treat me and other students in the
course as equals (I'm also a student, after all), 
and with respect and dignity. 

All UMN policies w.r.t academic integrity and freedom, 
disability accomidation and services, sexual harrassment and assult, 
and mental health apply. Refer to the syllabus of the course for details.

The parts about respect, dignity, and academic integrity
are of some concern here - I expect you to respect the course materials
enough to *not ChatGPT it*!
