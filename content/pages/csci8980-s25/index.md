# Info

This is my commentary on the book "Practical Foundations for Programming 
Languages" by Robert Harper, for the CSCI 8980 seminar taught by Professor
Eric van Wyk.

The goal of this commentary is to provide someone with a good-but-untrained
grasp on discrete mathematics and functional programming exposure an "in"
to gaining a deeper appreciation into PL constructs and type safety more 
generally. 

The expressiveness of the Rust typing system (to the point where 
[embedded-hal](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/)
can take the datasheet-y parts of embedded programming and roll it into
the type system) is something that I've gained a lot more appreciation
for while reading this textbook, so it's a pretty good read for systems
programmers getting into the type safety hype. (i.e me!)

The version on this website does not reflect the final version - most notably
MathJax does not render newlines cleanly like KaTeX on VSCode, so a final,
LaTeX typeset PDF will be provided.
